# WinForms Progress Bar - Update the progress from a separate thread

This example shows how to perform a file copy operation in a background thread and indicate progress of the operation on the main form. The [WinForms Progress Bar](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraEditors.ProgressBarControl) control is used to communicate operation state and supply feedback to end users.

> **Note**
>
> You can also use the [WinForms Wait Form](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/10824/controls-and-libraries/forms-and-user-controls/splash-screen-manager/wait-form) to indicate progress of time-consuming operations. The Wait Form runs in a separate thread and provides feedback to users regarding an applicationâ€™s state.
